# Memory

## Rules 
* At the start of the game, the user is presented with a grid of 24 facedown cards. 
* Each card looks identical face down, but has a face-up value that is matched by only one other card on the table. 
* When the user clicks a card, it flips over revealing its value. 
* When the user clicks the next card, its value is revealed and then compared against the other face-up card. 
  * If they are equal, both cards disappear.
  * If they are different, they flip back down. 
* The game is continued until there are no cards left.
